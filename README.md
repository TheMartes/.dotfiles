It's been a wild ride since I started using linux. I started with elementary due to it's look, switched to fedora, to *everyday need to maintain* arch linux and ended up on ubuntu. For Variety of reasons. Better stability, not so often updates, working system, less bugs etc. I'm currently very happy with it and that's important IMO. These dotfiles you can use on any other distro or OS which support unix files system.

# Tools I'm Using
### Development
+ **Editor and IDE:** 
    - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) / [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) (config compatible with NeoVim tho)
    - [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/)
+ **Terminal:** Gnome-Terminal w/ Tmux
+ **Database Client:** [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/).
+ **API Testing** is provided by [Postman](https://postman.com)
+ **Dev Environmet** are managed by [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [lazydocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker)
+ **GIT:** CLI driven :) + Sublime Merge *(I like how it shows you which command it will actually execute, that's the only reason i'm using it)*

### Terminal Essentials
Just standard toolkit: `vim`, `cat`, `awk`, `grep`, `tmux`

### Other tools
+ For music i'm using [Spotify](https://spotify.com)
+ Email client is [Geary](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Geary)
+ Browsers [ "[Firefox](https://www.firefox.com)", "[Chrome](https://chrome.google.com)" ]
+ For communication i'm using [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) & [Slack](https://slack.com/)
+ For Staying Organized I'm using [Notion](https://notion.so)
+ For Office I used to use [Google Docs](docs.google.com), since it's free and awesome.
+ Markdown is done in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which i'm using as my secondary editor.

And at the end, I'm keeping most of my files in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com).

## Installation
+ Install Plug (vim plugins system) => instructions [here](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug#vim)
+ Then open up vim and do `:PlugInstall` && restart vim
+ Copy & Paste the settings you want to use or symlink everything :) 

## More useful stuff
Since I liked the [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/), and I couldn't find anything close to it, I did a little research. It seems like **POP!_OS** has this cool thing called **[POP!_OS SHELL](https://github.com/pop-os/shell)**. What it does is, that it will add tiling window manager into the gnome shell, and let u use their **Application Launcher**

The Launcher itself can run/switch apps, but with a very clunky shortcut `Super+/`. *I HATE IT*. So I changed to shortcut to `Control+Space` 'cuse it's more convinient for me and forced pushed it to the master :))) >>> [Here's the repo](https://github.com/TheMartes/shell)

## Gnome Extensions
+ Alternate Tab
+ Bluetooth Quick Connect
+ Clipboard Indicator
+ Pop Shell (the modified version ;))
+ Refresh Wi-Fi Connections
+ Screenshot Tool
