## Config files installation
1. Clone repo into your $HOME and name it .files
2. Make sure you have Fish shell and OH-MY-FISH installed
3. Symlink all files. (Now you can pull repo for updated and every symlinked file will be changed)
4. Done

### Terminal commands
```shell-script
$ cd ~
$ git clone https://github.com/TheMartes/dotfiles .files
$ ln -s $HOME/.files/.aliases.sh $HOME/.aliases.sh

+ **API Testing** is delivered by [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
+ **Containers** are managed by [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), and [Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/valet) for localhost
