### Development
+ **Editor:** [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) + My [config files](https://gist.github.com/TheMartes/8321427fcb6491dca811b5c04f75271b)
+ **IDE:** Huge fan of [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/), helps me a lot in larger projects
+ **Terminal:** [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) + tmux [with my config] files(https://github.com/TheMartes/dotfiles/blob/master/.tmux.conf).
+ **Database Client:** [SequelPro](https://sequelpro.com/), probably most awesome MySQL Client for mac. For redis i'm using [Medis](http://getmedis.com/)
+ **API Testing** is delivered by [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)
+ **Docker** for containers, and [Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/valet) for localhost
+ **GIT GUI** of choice is [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)

### Other tools
+ For music i'm using [spotify](https://www.spotify.com/)
+ Email client is default mac app
+ Browser of choice is [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html)
+ For communication i'm using [Discord](https://discordapp.com/), [Slack](https://slack.com/) & [Telegram](https://telegram.org/)
+ Note taking app of choice is [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/)
+ [Trello](https://trello.com/) for staying organized
+ For Office i used to use [Google Docs](docs.google.com), since it's free and awesome, but for more complex work with documents in past few months i'm using [MS Office](https://products.office.com/)
+ Speaking of documents, for markdown is best [MacDown](http://macdown.uranusjr.com/)
+ My files are safe in [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)
+ [Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/) as my primary FTP Client
+ To be more productive on mac, i can't stand out Spotlight and Default App Switcher on mac (Alt + Tab), i've investigate a quick research, and i'm pretty happy with [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) and [Contexts](https://contexts.co/)

#### Bonus
I'm also using [JetBrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox/), to keep my IDE's Up2Date, and ðŸš€ [Emoji Picker](http://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/).
