It's been a wild ride since I started using linux. I started with elementary due to it's look, switched to fedora, to *everyday need to maintain* arch linux and ended up on ubuntu. For Variety of reasons. Better stability, not so often updates, working system, less bugs etc. I'm currently very happy with it and that's important IMO. These dotfiles you can use on any other distro or OS which support unix files system.
